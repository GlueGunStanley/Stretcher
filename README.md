# Stretcher ðŸ†“
âš  This resource is in an early access testing period.
## Known Issues ðŸ’¢
Players may notice a delay of up to two seconds between the time a player releases the stretcher and the time it takes for it to be set down on the ground properly. This is due to FiveM client syncronization methods. If you are aware of a solution to decrease or elimate this delay, please open an [issue](https://github.com/GlueGunStanley/Stretcher/issues) or create a [pull request](https://github.com/GlueGunStanley/Stretcher/pulls)!
